# RemNote Active Recall

## Usage

This plugin converts all the clozes and list answers into hidden state.
When you hover mouse or focus the cursor on them, they will be visible.

## Another way

If you'd like to apply this especially within a tagged rem, you can refer this @import string.
Just copy it and paste to your Custom CSS Codeblock.

```css
@import url("https://browneyedsoul.github.io/RemNote-CSS-Library/Active%20Recall.css");
```

And then, apply the `Active Recall` Power-up Tag in a rem where you'd like to apply hidden state.
