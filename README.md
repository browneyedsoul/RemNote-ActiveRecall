## Usage

This plugin hides all clozes and list answers that are tagged with the `Active Recall` Power-up. When you hover over them or focus the cursor on them, they will be visible.

## Configuration

To expand the scope beyond tagged rem, toggle the checkbox on the plugin settings page. This will include all clozes and Flash Card Answers without any tagging.
